# 📊 E-Commerce Customer Churn & Revenue Analysis

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes an e-commerce customer dataset to understand:

- Customer churn behavior  
- Revenue drivers  
- Lifetime value contribution  
- Discount impact  
- High-risk segments  

The objective was to simulate a real-world Business Intelligence case where data is cleaned using SQL and visualized in Power BI to generate actionable business insights.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **SQL** – Data cleaning, transformation, aggregation  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation & KPI visualization  
- **GitHub** – Version control & documentation  

---

## 📈 Key Business KPIs

- **Total Revenue:** 77M+  
- **Total Lifetime Value:** 68M+  
- **Churn Rate:** 29%  
- **Repeat Purchase Rate:** 100%  
- Revenue Contribution by Country  
- Discount Impact on Lifetime Value  
- High-Risk (Churn) Segments  

> Dashboard built using Power BI

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process (SQL)

- Created a cleaned view using `ISNULL()` handling  
- Engineered revenue calculation column  
- Standardized missing behavioral metrics  
- Applied filtering for valid demographic records  
- Generated churn and revenue indicators  

### Example Business Logic

- `Revenue = Total_Purchases × Average_Order_Value`  
- Repeat rate calculated using conditional aggregation  
- Churn rate calculated by country and segment

## 📊 Analytical Features

✔ Country-wise revenue contribution  
✔ Signup quarter performance  
✔ Top 10 high-value customers  
✔ Revenue by membership years  
✔ Discount usage impact on Lifetime Value  
✔ High-risk churn segments by country  
✔ Repeat purchase rate calculation

## 📊 Dashboard Insights (Power BI)

The Power BI dashboard includes:

- Revenue & Lifetime Value overview  
- Churn Rate (%)  
- Repeat Rate (%)  
- Country-level revenue distribution  
- Membership-based revenue trend  
- Signup quarter customer analysis  

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Certain countries show higher churn risk despite strong revenue contribution  
- High discount users show variation in lifetime value  
- Revenue increases with longer membership duration  
- Behavioral metrics (cart abandonment & inactivity) strongly correlate with churn
